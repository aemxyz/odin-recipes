    <p><em>This Teriyaki Chicken recipe will quickly become a new favorite! In this one pan recipe, bite size chicken breasts pieces are sautéed in a skillet then coated with an easy and deliciously flavorful sauce.</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken breasts:</strong> use boneless skinless. Chicken thighs will work great too, just cook a little longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Vegetable oil can be used here as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-sodium soy sauce:</strong> You can also use 2 1/2 Tbsp standard soy sauce with 1 1/2 Tbsp water.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey:</strong> If you don’t have this you can use more brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> I use light brown sugar, dark would be fine or even granulated sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice vinegar:</strong> Apple cider vinegar will work well too. Even lemon juice can be used in a pinch.</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame oil:</strong> This has a bold flavor, so a little goes a long way. Unrefined peanut oil can be used as well, add extra.</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Fresh is best, but if you must 1/2 tsp dried ginger could be used</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Again fresh is better, but 1 tsp dried granulated will work.</li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch:</strong> This helps thicken the sauce so it is critical to the recipe. Arrowroot starch could be substituted.</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame seeds and green onions:</strong> Optional garnishes. Add them if preferred.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and let cook (giving space between pieces) until slightly browned on bottom then flip chicken pieces over and cook through.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking whisk together the teriyaki sauce mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce into the skillet once the chicken is just nearly finished cooking through and let the sauce cook and simmer until thickened.</li>
        <li>Easy as that! Serve it warm over brown or white rice with steamed veggies.</li>
    </ol>
